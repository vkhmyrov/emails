                <h4>Creative Brief: Taste of Heritage</h4>
                <p>To help inspire honest, impactful visual content that truly resonates, we’ve designed eight intersectional creative briefs for visuals in 2021. Taste of Heritage is our creative brief for imagery exploring food, cooking, ingredients—and how our interactions with food and cooking embody our lineage and our values. Everyone is invited to participate: no matter what your background, we hope you’ll be inspired and energized to shoot and submit your tastiest images.</p>
